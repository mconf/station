module ActionController #:nodoc:
  # Authorization module provides your Controllers and Views with methods and filters
  # to control which actions Agents can perform
  #
  # This module uses Agent identification support from ActionController::Authentication
  #
  # == Authorization Filters
  # You can define authorization filters in the following way:
  #   authorization_filter permission, auth_object, filter_options
  #
  # permission:: Argument defining the Permission, examples: :read, :destroy, [ :update, :task ]
  # auth_object:: a Symbol representing a controller's instance variable name or method. This variable or method gives the authorization object, an instance that will be queried for checking authorization. This is actually achived calling <tt>auth_object.authorize?(permission, :to => current_agent)</tt>. See ActiveRecord::Authorization to define authorization security policies.
  # fiter_options:: Available options are:
  #  if:: A Proc proc{ |controller| ... } or Symbol to be executed as condition of the filter
  #   
  #  The rest of options are passed to before_filter. See Rails before_filter documentation
  #   
  #
  # === Examples
  #
  #  class AttachmentsController < ActionController::Base
  #    authorization_filter [ :read, :attachment ], :space, { :only => [ :index ] }
  #    authorization_filter [ :create, :attachment ], :space, { :only => [ :new, :create ] }
  #
  #    authorization_filter :read, :attachment, :only => [ :show ]
  #    authorization_filter :update, :attachment, :only => [ :edit, :update ]
  #    authorization_filter :delete, :attachment, :only => [ :destroy ]
  #
  #  end
  #
